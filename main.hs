call play (inspiration from Nim.hs) which plays the chess game until it is finished
call playTurn/turn/turnPlayer1

   SIDE-EFFECTS: Asking for an input and printing out lines
-}
call to makeAMove. Arguments: Board (and maybe White since player 1's turn)
getLine (startPos, endPos). (If startPos not holding White piece then InvalidMove and repeat getLine somehow, this might be done in validMove)
call to validMove with the arguments: Board, startPos, endPos, White. (might want to convert startPos and endPos to something easier to handle for our functions
if White is necessary). If validMove returns False -> InvalidMove and repeat getLine somehow, else continue.
call to move. Arguments: Board, startPos, endPos. Which returns an updated board.
(Somewhere in these calls a call to check if you put yourself into check might get added)
call to isCheck. Arguments: Board, (possibly Black King). Checks if Black King is in check. If True then print something that tells the players Black King
is in check
Now graphics or other representation of the board should be updated to the new board. (This might happen before isCheck is called)
Player 1's turn is now over. (Maybe a check somewhere if Black King still exists on board, this might be done earlier by checking if endPos holds Black King
and validMove returns True)
-}

{-
Player 2 should now be able to make their move. (unless player 1 wins)
Everything should work the same. However, instead validMove should check if endPos is White instead and isCheck should check White King. StartPos should
also be checked to see if Black piece.
